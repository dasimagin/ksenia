#+TITLE: What to do next
* Todos [0/3]
- [ ] Get basic NTM implementation working on gpu
  Use [[https://github.com/loudinthecloud/pytorch-ntm%20this%20][this]] implementation as a main reference
- [ ] Test on copy and repeat copy
- [ ] Implement DNC
* Ideas
- Test different versions of manns against default lstm baselines in some real
  world tasks (such as speech recognition, question answering)
- Use different controller networks (for example pretrained ones, and than add
  interaction with memory).
- Test how each part of a DNC contributes to the results. Make many
  visualizations, try different real and synthetic tasks.
  - Separate keys from values in DNC memory like in DNTM
  - Combine vision and language tasks
- Test different read/write heads configurations
- Experiments with a stack (much simpler reading and writing)
